This is a GUI and VNC Server example.

Use this example to connect an evaluation board to a LAN with DHCP server (most
LANs have this). The example will configure the network parameters
automatically using a DHCP protocol.

If a DHCP server is not available, you may connect an evaluation board to PC
directly over a crosslink network cable. In this case configure a PC to use a
static IP address 192.168.0.1 and disable a 'Dynamic Host Configuration' in
Net_Config.c configuration file. The default static IP address of this example
is set to 192.168.0.100 in Net_Config_ETH_0.h.

To test this example, download the VNC Viewer from
https://www.realvnc.com/download/viewer/ and run it. Enter "stm32f746g-dk" for the VNC
Server or the respective IP address. You'll be able to toggle the board LED
using the VNC Viewer or the graphical UI displayed on the LCD TFT.
